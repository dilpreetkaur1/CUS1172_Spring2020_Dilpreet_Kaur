## Deployment 
For the deployment of my application, I utilized a web developer platform called Netlify; which aims to enable a 10 times faster path to a secure, proficient, and scalable website and apps. In order to launch my application of Netlify, I connected the server to my GitHub account and gave authorization to the application. As well as access to my private repository.  Netlify also allows you to create build commands. However, since I did not have a JSON file and was using a database outside of my repository, I did not use any build commands. After, Netlify creates a site and displays a unique public URL to your website. Finally, Netlify allows to automatically update the development as I push my changes or merge pull requests to GitHub

## Built With
* [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) - The web framework used
